TODO: Top Travellers

-- Easy Company Tags

-- Given two tables, users and rides, write a query to calculate the total distance traveled by each user.

-- users table:
-- Column Name 	Type
-- id 	int
-- name 	varchar

-- The id column is the primary key. This table contains user information including their unique ID and name.

-- rides table:
-- Column Name 	Type
-- id 	int
-- user_id 	int
-- distance 	int

-- The id column is the primary key. Each row represents a trip where user_id indicates who took the trip and distance is how far they traveled.

-- Write a SQL query that reports the total distance each user has traveled. Return the results sorted by travelled_distance in descending order. If multiple users have the same total distance, sort them by name in ascending order.

-- Example 1:

-- Input:

-- users table:
-- id 	name
-- 1 	Maria
-- 2 	Carlos
-- 3 	Priya
-- 4 	James

-- rides table:
-- id 	user_id 	distance
-- 1 	1 	150
-- 2 	2 	280
-- 3 	3 	195
-- 4 	1 	130
-- 5 	2 	95

-- Output:
-- name 	travelled_distance
-- Carlos 	375
-- Maria 	280
-- Priya 	195
-- James 	0

-- Explanation:

--     Carlos has two trips totaling 375 miles (280 + 95).
--     Maria has two trips totaling 280 miles (150 + 130).
--     Priya has one trip of 195 miles.
--     James has no rides recorded, so their traveled distance is 0.

-- Write your query below
SELECT a.name, 
       CASE
            WHEN b.travelled_distance IS NOT NULL THEN b.travelled_distance
            ELSE 0  
       END as travelled_distance 
FROM users a
LEFT JOIN (SELECT user_id, sum(distance) as travelled_distance
            FROM rides
            group by user_id) as b ON b.user_id = a.id
ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, a.name ASC
